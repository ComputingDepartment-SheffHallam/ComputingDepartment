# ComputingDepartment
Web Site for our redesign of computing department of Sheffield Hallam university. Now Hosted live at http://coding.georgelangham.net/Comp-Dept

At this point in time the development is as far as we want to take it for this prototype.

At a later point we may come back and fix bugs and add features.

But currently the prototype shall remain closed as it is.
